                            architecting,
                            decision making
                            and effectively communicating with everyone ranging from interns through to board members and

                        I am somebody who likes to fully understand a problem so that I can apply a higher level of
                        thinking and find opportunities to do better. I don't want to just pick tasks of the board,
                        write some code and move the task right. I want to see if there is an opportunity to exceed
                        expectation with every task. This could manifest itself as a conversation that results in a
                        modified requirement that produces a better feature, some automation that reduces future work,
                        better test automation or a more efficient feature in terms of cost and or availability for example.
